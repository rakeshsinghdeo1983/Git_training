git pull 	git fetch
This command pulls new changes from the currently working branch located in the remote central repository.	This command is also used for a similar purpose but it follows a two step process: 
1. Pulls all commits and changes from desired branch and stores them in a new branch of the local repository. 
current
2. For changes to be reflected in the current / target branch, git fetch should be followed by git merge command.
